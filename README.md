Smart Typing Tutor - Learn Type in  a smart way - practice the letter combinations in what you are the slowest

## Idea

Start with the row asdf. Program asks two letters, practice it. Then other two letters while the row is not covered and
all two letters combinations are pressed fats enough.

Than 3 letters combinations. Than 4 and 5.
Now back to two letters combinations but add a new letter from it from the qwert  row and so on.

Word means a letter combination with a given lenght and given letters. Like _as_ , _sa_, _assa_, etc.
There will be 3 "words" on the screen.
The first is what is should be typed in now.
The second word will be the next which should be typed.
The third is a hint. If the progress is not adequate (the typing speed/correctness is not good), the third word is changing.
The program recounts after every "word typing" the goodness of the letter combinations in it (the speed of the letter pairs,
triads, etc. in it) and changes the hint word.

In this way, learner will learn always what needs practicing the most.

## main idea
The main idea is that tasks are always and nearly immediately adapting to the learners.
